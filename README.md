This repository demonstrates an uncommon C++ error related to erasing elements from a `std::vector` within a loop.  The example code shows how modifying the vector's size while iterating based on index can lead to unexpected results, skipping elements. The solution provides a corrected approach to achieve the intended behavior.  The problem arises from the change in the index as the vector shrinks. The solution explores safe ways to remove vector elements while avoiding index issues.
